    question: "What makes ExaminAI's agentic approach different?",
    answer: "ExaminAI uses autonomous AI agents that can understand context, make decisions, and adapt to user needs without constant human intervention. Unlike traditional AI tools that follow fixed patterns, our agentic system continuously learns from interactions, improving its ability to generate relevant questions, provide personalized feedback, and adapt to different learning styles.",

    category: 'technology'
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI-powered exam creation work?",
    answer: "Our agentic AI system analyzes your course content and learning objectives to automatically generate relevant questions across different difficulty levels. The system uses advanced natural language processing to understand context, identify key concepts, and create questions that test true comprehension rather than mere memorization. You can customize parameters like question types, topics, and complexity to match your specific needs.",

    category: 'technology'
  },
  {
    question: "Is ExaminAI secure for conducting high-stakes exams?",
    answer: "Yes, ExaminAI implements enterprise-grade security measures including AI-powered proctoring, advanced plagiarism detection, and end-to-end encrypted data transmission to ensure exam integrity. Our system uses biometric authentication and continuous behavior analysis to verify student identities and prevent cheating, making it suitable for high-stakes assessments.",

    category: 'security'
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is the AI grading system for subjective answers?",
    answer: "Our AI grading system has been trained on millions of exam responses and maintains a 99% accuracy rate compared to expert human graders. For subjective questions, it uses advanced natural language understanding and contextual analysis to evaluate responses based on content, reasoning, and relevance rather than just keywords. The system can recognize different approaches to solving problems and provides detailed feedback on strengths and areas for improvement.",
    icon: <FaChartLine />,
    category: 'technology'
  },
  {
    question: "Can I integrate ExaminAI with my existing educational technology stack?",
    answer: "Yes, ExaminAI offers seamless integration with major LMS platforms including Canvas, Blackboard, and Moodle through our comprehensive API. We also support SSO authentication, grade passback, and content synchronization with most educational technology platforms. Our dedicated integration team can assist with custom implementations for specialized systems.",
    icon: <FaPlug />,
    category: 'integration'
  },
  {
    question: "How does ExaminAI adapt to different learning styles?",
    answer: "ExaminAI's agentic system builds a comprehensive profile of each student's learning patterns, strengths, and areas for improvement. It then tailors question types, difficulty progression, and feedback style to match individual learning preferences. The system continuously refines its approach based on student performance and engagement metrics, creating a truly personalized assessment experience.",

    category: 'usage'
  },
  {
    question: "What support does ExaminAI provide for educators?",
    answer: "Educators receive comprehensive analytics dashboards, automated grading assistance, and content generation tools that significantly reduce administrative workload. Our system provides insights into class performance patterns, identifies knowledge gaps, and suggests targeted interventions. We also offer professional development resources and a dedicated support team to help educators maximize the platform's capabilities.",

  {
    question: "Is ExaminAI available in multiple languages?",
